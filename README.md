# ESP8266-WiFi-Microphone

Introduction
This project is an ESP8266 WiFi Microphone firmware arduino source code (.ino) which can play live sound and voices with up to 80Kbps (10bit @8KHz) quality. (To using more powerful WiFi microphone and voice recorder arduino project, please refer to our website: https://wicard.net/projects)
There are the following files in this project:
1-	ESP8266WiFiMicrophoneFree.ino (Main handler file)
2-	AC.h – Project global variables and definitions file.
3-	AC.ino – Project WiFi settings and config file.
4-	MicPage.ino – This file contains the WiFi Microphone WebApp’s script.

Uploading the project
First open one of the files with Arduino program, then set the settings as the following image (Board revision and board type):
 (Refer to the PDF file) Figure 1-Arduino settings
•	The “Board” must be set on one of the ESP8266 Modules before doing anything. 
WaveShare Sound Sensor
WaveShare sound sensor is an audio amplifier and sensor with LM386. This module is compatible with this project.
 
ESP8266 WiFi Microphone Schematics
It’s suggested to use a standard 3.3V microphone module (like “WaveShare Sound Sensor”). The ADC pin (A0) of esp8266 is the audio signal input. Before using the WiFi microphone, build one of the following circuits. 
Here’s a simple circuit with WaveShare Sound Sensor and ESP8266 NodeMCU:
 (Refer to the PDF file) Figure 3-WaveShare and ESP8266 NodeMCU schematic
And here’s a suggested circuit with a simple capacitive microphone, LM386, Memory module and NodeMCU:
 (Refer to the PDF file) Figure 4-LM386 and ESP8266 Schematic
And here’s a suggested circuit with a simple capacitive microphone, LM386 and ESP8266MOD (ESP12):
 (Refer to the PDF file) Figure 5-LM386 and ESP8266 module Schematic
In the above schematic (LM386 and ESP8266MOD), LED1 shows the power is on, SW1 is the ESP8266 module reset button, H1 is the module’s UART connector (for flashing/programming) and H2 pin header needs a jumper to put the ESP12 module in the flash programming mode.
The microphone block has a potentiometer (P1) to calibrating the input audio signal. In the low level, the audio noise will decrease but the output audio is weaker and in the high level you can hear the small voices but more noisy.
•	Better to use a 5-12V power source with 2A output drain capability.
•	The module must only receive 3.3v (from the LF33 regulator). Higher voltage will hurt the module.
The ESP8266 WiFi Microphone Web Application
After upload, the program will run automatically.
Then the blue LED on the board would be turned on. Then you’ll be able to see the module’s hot spot ssid via the WiFi networks in your PC or smart phone.
The default SSID is WiCardMp and the default password is 12345678. Connect and go to 192.168.4.1/config with a web browser.

The WiFi configuration page:
 (Refer to the PDF file) Figure 6-WiFi configuration
In the “Modem Configuration” section, you’re able to view/edit the SSID and password of WiFi modem/router and then click on “Save” after inserting. The module would connect to the modem after about 30 seconds in case of validity of ssid and password.
•	This page is also available via the DHCP IP of the module.
In the “Device Hot Spot Configuration” section, you can set the module hotspot’s SSID and password. Also you can set a password for the internal page with Secure Link section. (Example: the secure link is ABCD and the root page would be at 192.168.4.1/ABCD/ address)
The “Hidden HotSpot” button will set the module’s hot spot as hidden hotspot and the “Disable HotSpot when is connected to the modem” would disable the module’s hotspot, when is connected to the modem.
The stream configuration
The stream configuration is in the bottom of “config” page:
 (Refer to the PDF file)Figure 7-Stream Configuration
With “Audio Stream Bitrate” the quality of the audio stream can be set in 60, 70 or 80Kbps.
•	The signal strength must be higher for higher quality.
The “Audio Stream Packet Length” sets the stream time in 5, 10, 30 or 60 minutes.

The Audio Stream Page
This page is in the root address (192.168.4.1 or the router’s given IP) and decodes the received data from module to the audio stream.
After opening the page, wait for a few seconds for the initial file loading. Then click on the “play”.
This page records audio data to in the browser’s cache automatically. Also you can play the audio and listen to the audio lively at the same time.
 (Refer to the PDF file)Figure 8-Live Stream
The preset time is 10 minutes. After this time spent, you can refresh the page and record again.
To downloading the audio file directly, go to 192.168.4.1/s (or the router’s given IP).
•	If you close the web page, recording will be aborted.
Do not open two pages at the same time. The module can handle only one page at a time.

Microphone Calibration
There is a calibration page in “192.168.4.1/cal” which shows the audio signal. When there’s no noise and voice, the signal must be a straight horizontal line at the center of scope. So if the signal is lower than middle lines (like the following image), try to calibrate it with adding load, pull up and pull down resistors.
 (Refer to the PDF file)Figure 9-Oscilloscope
Also you can see the input audio signal shape in this page and filter it with load and decoupling capacitors if it is necessary:
 (Refer to the PDF file)Figure 10-Audio Signal
The audio signal uses 8000Hz sample rate with 10 bits resolution which gives a low quality souond. To receive more quality sounds, please use the newer revisions of this project: https://wicard.net/projects 

To opening the calibration page:
-	Close the root page (192.168.0.113), close all the pages and then after a few seconds open calibration page (192.168.0.113/cal) or Re-start the module, then open calibration page after the module connected to the modem.
•	The WiFi signal strength takes effect on the module capability and the audio streams.
The ADC voltage must be between 0 and 3.3V (power source).
